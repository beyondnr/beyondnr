# PROJECT OVERVIEW: SCON (Shift Control)

## Vision
SCON (Shift Control) is a SaaS solution designed to simplify shift management for bakery cafes and small to medium-sized businesses. It aims to eliminate the chaos of manual scheduling, optimize labor costs, and streamline communication between managers and part-time staff through an intuitive interface and AI-powered automation.

## Core Features
- **Smart Dashboard**: Real-time overview of today's workers, pending approvals, and estimated labor costs.
- **Shift Management**: Intuitive schedule planning with availability checking and conflict detection.
- **Onboarding Wizard**: Step-by-step setup flow for stores, simplifying account creation, store details, and staff registration.
- **Reports**: Automated payroll calculations and operational cost analysis.
- **AI Assistant (Genkit)**: Future-ready features for auto-scheduling and operational optimization suggestions.

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Store Owners & Managers (Bakery Cafes, Retail, F&B) who spend excessive time on manual scheduling.
- **Secondary Users**: Part-time Employees who need easy access to their schedules and a simple way to request shift changes.

## Project Goals
- **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on scheduling by 50% through UI optimizations and automation.
- **Accuracy**: Eliminate payroll calculation errors and scheduling conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Build a robust architecture capable of supporting multi-store management.

## Success Metrics
- **User Activation**: Completion rate of the Onboarding Wizard.
- **Retention**: Daily/Weekly Active Users (DAU/WAU) checking the dashboard.
- **Task Completion Time**: Time taken to create and publish a weekly schedule.

## Project Philosophy
- **Dashboard First**: Prioritize the most critical information (Approvals, Costs) on the landing screen.
- **Simplicity**: Complex logic (e.g., labor laws, overtime) should be hidden behind a simple UI.
- **Reliability**: Data integrity is paramount for payroll and attendance records.
- **Modern Tech**: Leverage Next.js 15, Firebase, and Genkit for a high-performance, serverless, and AI-ready stack.
