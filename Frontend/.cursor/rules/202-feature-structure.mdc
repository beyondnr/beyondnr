# Feature-Based Folder Structure

## Core Philosophy
- **Colocation**: Keep related code (components, hooks, utils) close together.
- **Feature Separation**: Group code by business feature, not by technical type.

## Directory Structure Rules

### 1. `app/` (Routing Layer)
- Contains ONLY routing logic (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`).
- Keep these files minimal. Import complex logic from `features/`.

### 2. `features/` (Business Logic Layer)
- Structure: `features/<feature-name>/`
  - `components/`: Feature-specific UI components
  - `hooks/`: Custom hooks for this feature
  - `lib/` or `utils/`: Feature-specific helpers
  - `types/`: Feature-specific type definitions (if not inferred from Zod)
- Example: `features/auth/`, `features/dashboard/`, `features/chat/`

### 3. `components/ui/` (Shared UI Layer)
- Dumb UI components only (Buttons, Inputs, Cards).
- Mostly Shadcn UI components. No business logic here.

### 4. `lib/` (Shared Utilities)
- Global singleton instances (e.g., `firebase.ts`, `db.ts`).
- Generic helpers used across multiple features (e.g., `date-utils.ts`).

## Import Rules
- Prefer absolute imports (e.g., `@/features/auth/...`) over relative (`../../`).
